This is my personal website, my portfolio. I come here once in a while to share stuff about me, techology related. I am on a quest to be a renowned software developer and am keen on showcasing what I can do.



-Tech Stack:
This site is built using node.js express, sqlite3, html and css. It is a full stack site and I would love to get messages from whomever wants to connect with me.
